                  For us, taking care of our people is about making sure they
                  can show up for work every day, with less stress, and more
                  support. That’s why we make it a priority to provide an array
                  of medical benefit plans, short and long-term disability,
                  retirement planning, stellar PTO, employee assistance
                  programs, sponsored legal benefits, and a casual work
                  environment. How’s that for a little TLC?

                    The <b>opportunity</b> to find your own path is what makes
                    this company special. Do you want to focus on one

                    memories I have at Synoptek surround the camaraderie of
                    <b>people</b> - not necessarily working, but simply spending

                    I love working for Synoptek because their corporate values
                    so closely match my own so it feels like a natural fit.
                    Having spent the bulk of my career in large organizations
                    Synoptek, as a smaller organization, has been paradigm
                    changing for me because they don’t have the massive
                    hierarchy and bureaucracy so the opportunity to present new
                    ideas and actually have them not just listened to by the
                    decision makers but for decisions to be made in very short
                    periods of time. Synoptek really makes me feel like I am
                    making a huge difference.
