            <h2>Why Healthcare Companies Need Managed IT Services</h2>
            <p>
              As the healthcare industry experiences substantial growth,
              managing data across stand-alone EHRs is becoming increasingly
              complex. The presence of siloed and rigid legacy systems means
              they are exceptionally fragmented, complex to control and monitor,
              and harder to support and drive value. You need to be able to
              efficiently manage the growing risk while ensuring HIPAA
              compliance at all times.
